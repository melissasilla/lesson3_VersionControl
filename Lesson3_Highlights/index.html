            <p class="lead">A Version Control System (VCS) is a unique system that keeps track of all the changes done on a file. Using a version control system has its benefits. For example, a graphic designer would find a VCS helpful because it is simple to keep original/pervious versions of specific projects. A version control system keeps a track on when a project was started, the reason behind why the project was started with the addition of comments, and even what changes were done to the particular project. A VCS such as Git is beneficial to use because it is extremely fast, provides a history of changes/history tracking, and user-friendly for any worker.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Behind a powerful version control system such as Git, there is a history of its beginning. The development of Git began in 2005. Before creating Git, the Linux kernel started working on a distributed version control system called BitKeeper. Apparently in 2005, the relationship between Linux and BitKeeper came to a downfall. After this occurrence, the creators of Linux decided to take matters into their own hands and develop a version control system that is very simple and also efficient with data and speed. With all of this in Mind, Git was finally created, providing users with a fast, efficient system where multiple individuals can work together.</div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a few differences between Git and other version control systems. Although Git is a version control system, it stores data a bit differently. Git will take the info in its system as a photo album. Git takes snapshots of a recently saved project. Because of this, history tracking is simple and it easier to pull out an original version of a project if necessary. Another quality that Git has is that Git only uses local files to function. Since Git operates like so, files are retrieved rapidly and it is possible to work offline on the go without network connection.

</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Git repository contains a set of commits objects and a set of references relating to commit objects, which are called heads. To track an existing project within Git, going to the project’s directory and using the command ‘$ cd’ will help you find the existing project. There are several commands used within Git to carry out an action. For example, using the command ‘git add .’, you are able to add newly modified files into the current directory. ‘git commit’ records any modifications that was done to a project. Using the command ‘git clone’ creates a copy of an existing Git repository.  Also, typing ‘git init’ creates a new repository.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Within the Git directory, each file can either be in two different states, tracked or untracked. A tracked file contains all of the latest changes within a project that can be modified if necessary. An untracked file is basically all of the work history within a directory. In Git, you are able to track new files, move files, check the status of your files, just to name a few. There are many commands within Git that can help with these options. For example, to check the status of your files, using ‘git status’  will show you the state of your files.
